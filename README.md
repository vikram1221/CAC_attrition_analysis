# Congressional App Challenge – Attrition Analysis
Context

The Congressional App Challenge (CAC) is a nationwide coding competition designed to encourage student engagement in computer science through district-level participation. While participation is widespread, not all registered teams ultimately submit a completed application. Understanding attrition—the failure to submit after registration—is important for improving program design, equity, and student outcomes.

This project analyzes participant-level CAC data to identify behavioral and socioeconomic factors associated with attrition. The goal is not prediction for its own sake, but to generate interpretable insights that can inform outreach, engagement strategies, and resource allocation.
